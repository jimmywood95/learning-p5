Work locally on a project and then add and commit the files to the repo when you are done.
Rather than add commit push every time you save. VScode handily highlights in yellow any 
changed files. Theres a lot more to learn about Git and GitHub but this is a start.

#### Add any newly created files to 'staging' I think...
git add .

#### Commit changes
git commit -a -m "Note about the commit here"

#### publish from local files to the GitHub Repository.
git push // git push origin main

#### branching
git branch <name>

#### moving to a different branch
git checkout <name>
